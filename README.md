# Pokémon TCG SDK - Java

This is a Java/Maven project containing the classes of Version 2 of the Pokémon TCG API 
and a Reader class with static methods to read the data.

### Before you start using the Reader, put your own X-Api-Key in the Constants class

The code in this project is minimalistic, meaning not robust yet.
I just use it to create extracts, other json files etc.
